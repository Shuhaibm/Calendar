## Calendar

All throughout highschool, my teachers **constantly** encouraged the use of agendas, but I never found 
the need to use one. However, once I entered university, it immediately became clear that an agenda
would make my life much easier, and help me stay on top of classes. I began to print out a calendar
every month, and list out all the things I needed to get done. These included:
- Assignments
- Forms/Paperwork
- Meetings
- Events 

I will stop wasting paper and take advantage of technology by creating a calendar application. I will
use this application instead of what I have been doing up until now. The application will present a 
monthly calendar, where the user can add items to a specific day, and check them off when they have 
been completed. 


## User Stories
