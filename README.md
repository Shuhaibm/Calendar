## Calendar

All throughout highschool, I have been encouraged to use agendas, but I never found the need to use one. 
However, once I entered university, it immediately became clear that an agenda would make my life much 
easier, and help me stay on top of classes. I began to print out a calendar every month, and list out 
all the things I needed to get done.
I will make a Calendar application that will allow me to do so, it will present a monthly calendar, 
where the user can add items to a specific day, and check them off when they have been completed. 


## User Stories
- As a user, I am able to add multiple objectives to any day in my Calendar
- As a user, I am able to check off an objective and mark it complete
- As a user, I am able to remove an objective from a day in my Calendar
- As a user, I am able to view all objectives in each day in my Calendar
- As a user, I am able to save the current state of my Calendar
- As a user, I have the option of loading the previously saved Calendar
